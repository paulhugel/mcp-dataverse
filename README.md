# MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Dataverse

Credits: this work is funded by [SSHOC-NL](https://sshoc.nl) project developing [Semantic Croissant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fi9Lb6x5Wm0L9CZftqjSGElV_ifcSW_IT-H8ZlpbrtQ/edit?tab=t.0). First version of [Croissant ML](https://docs.mlcommons.org/croissant/docs/croissant-spec.html) export for Dataverse was implemented by Phil Durbin (Harvard IQSS) and Slava Tykhonov (DANS-KNAW).

If you don't know what Croissant ML is — it's a special language for machines, built on top of Schema.org. With Croissant, we aim to solve multilingual challenges and finally speak the same language across the planet.
Even if it's artificial.

Installation:
```
cp .env-sample .env
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/tools to get an overview of available tools. We have also deployed official Dataverse MCP server on https://mcp.dataverse.org

You can register MCP in Cursor, Visual Studio or Windsurf Editor, or other IDE with AI Agents support. For example, create configuration file for Cursor [~/.cursor/mcp.json](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol):
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Croissant": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
    }
}
}
```

To register this MCP server in Visual Studio Code ([official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)), open settings and search for "mcp". Click the link "edit in settings.json" under "Model Context Protocol server configurations" and paste the "mcp-dataverse" objects below, which are shown in a simplified version of that configuration file.

```
{
...
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "mcp-dataverse-local": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse"
      },
      "mcp-dataverse-remote": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "https://mcp.dataverse.org/sse"
      }
    }
  }
...
}
```

Next, click "view", then "open chat". Choose "Agent" in the dropdown that offers "Ask", "Edit", and "Agent".

Your new MCP servers should be configured for use but you can check if they are enabled or disable one of them by clicking the "select tools" icon (just below the chat input area) and scrolling down to them (here you can also try the "add more tools" button).

Continue with the instructions below about what to try typing to the agent.

## Test Croissant ML support for Dataverse
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tools/get_croissant_record" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"doi":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WGCRY7"}'
```

## Connect MCP to your favourite IDE

Type in the chat of Agent:
```
Connect to MCP server running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 and explore all tools with curl command.

```
If everything is connected properly you should see this response from the Agent:
```
Based on the dataset information, this is a scientific dataset related to quantum physics research. Here are the key details:
Dataset Title: "Replication Data for: All-Optical Photoluminescence Spectra of Nitrogen-Vacancy Ensembles in Diamond at Low Magnetic Fields"
Description:
This dataset contains experimental data from research on Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond
It includes data shown in both the main text and supplemental material of the associated scientific paper
The research focuses on photoluminescence spectra at low magnetic fields
```
## Multilingual support

Let's connect to a dataset in Dutch and ask questions in English. Example dataset is taken from [DANS Archaelogy Data Station](https://archaeology.datastations.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.17026/AR/IQZTRX):
```
give me overview of doi:10.17026/dans-xv2-dsx6
```
The response in English:
```
